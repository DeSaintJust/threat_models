m9 = "Scan for supply chain threats using SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) tooling."
m10 = "Monitor public feeds for compromised packages (e.g., Sonatype, Snyk)."

m12 = "Use least privilege: restrict who can access the server and what they can do."
m13 = "Regularly rotate credentials and monitor access logs."
m14 = "Use hardware-backed key storage (e.g., YubiKeys)."
m15 = "Enforce zero-trust network access (ZTNA) â€” no implicit trust for credentials."
